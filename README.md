Hi!  
I am Rajeshwari Jadhav.  
I love reading books,sketching,listening to music and travelling.


I got introduced to Open Source Projects during the Code Peak event.  
Open sourcing a project makes collaboration much easier as anyone can suggest changes for the betterment of the project.This helps in improving projects at a quicker pace.  
Also, such projects are available for everyone to use.  
Hence, I would love to contribute.
